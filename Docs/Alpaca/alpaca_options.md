# Alpaca Options Documentation

## Summary
The purpose of this document is to document research on the options available for implementing the Alpaca framework into the "Smart Stock" project via account plans.

### Account Plan Options
List of options available for implementation.

- **Alpaca Paper Only Account (Paper-Trading)** : Requires only a sign-up account, completely free. Maintains access to the Alpaca API without any investment on our end. Likely preferable given our budget. Starts with a simulated budget of $100,000.
- **Alpaca Brokerage Account (Live-Trading)** : Enables live-trading, rather than simulated trading, but requires money. Depending on the variant (i.e. business account or singular), costs could range from $2,000 to $30,000. Would not recommend given our situation.

## Overall View
### Recommendation
Given the budget we have, and the requirements we need, it would be best to just go with a paper-trading to test out the framework so that it runs in tandem with any program we intend to run.
