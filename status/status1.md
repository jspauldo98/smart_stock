- **OTHER MEMBER WORK HERE**

## Successes
- Constructing beautiful and functional login, registration, portfolio, and homepage services, along with Alpaca experimentation has been our most recent, but great successes.

## Roadblocks/Challenges
- Figuring out how to efficiently use Alpaca and begin trying new things with the third party API has been our greatest challenge, as we have been focusing intently on UI and API development. 

- Spencer : Ran into a problem with having my hard drive fail, causing a delay on my end that lasted for nearly a week as the hard drive had to get replaced and the data re-transferred. 

## Changes/Plan Deviations
- No changes or plan deviations with the exception of Spencer's hard drive. All members have been a little busy, so we are not as ahead as we'd like to be.

## Next 3 Weeks Goals/Plans
- Complete the homepage refinements, such as navbar/toolbar functionality, and summary services surrounding those features.
- Begin constructing basic trading scripts, and activating them based on initial user preference submission.
- Complete portfolio data retrieval and view generation.
- Make sure that Python scripts are writing all relevant trading information to database table.

## Completion Confidence (Per Member)
- Stefan: 5
- Spencer: Despite beinig sidelined for the majority of the development process in the last three weeks, I feel good about where everyone is going, and where the project is too, so out of a scale of 1-10, I'm going with an 8.
- Bryce: 5
