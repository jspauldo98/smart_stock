   <p>
      The stock market has been widely traded for decades by many different types of people, but consistently among each user group there has always existed the variability of emotions. All market traders face this inevitability at one point or another as they are too attached to their investment to make an emotionless decision that will impact their future holdings.

   <p>Despite the explosion of commission-free trading platforms in the past decade, the lack of assistance and built-in education is astonishing. It is incredibly easy to lose money in these types of applications.</p>

   <p>Training groups have begun to grow in popularity in an attempt to mitigate the emotional attachment to the monetary value of a trade by encouraging accountability of specific trading strategies. This could and does work for extremely experienced traders who can trade in an exceptionally disciplined manor, but most people interested in trading the stock market or any market donâ€™t have the time to become experienced traders.
