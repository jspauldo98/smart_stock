## Synopsis of Project Goal(s)
The intended goal at the beginning of the project was to develop an attractive, easy to use, and convenient stock trading web application that removes the emotions from manual trading practices and incorporates a level of automation. We wanted to build a tool that would help individuals enjoy investing, while being able to profit with limited lending.

It should be noted that throughout the project's life cycle the goals shifted a bit. This is discussed below in greater detail.
